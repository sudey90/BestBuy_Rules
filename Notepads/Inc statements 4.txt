user out of BBY Network:-
------------------------------
Brayan called in for password reset and
Issue: Brayan was trying to login to Windows with the temporary password provided by HelpDesk. Temporary password wouldn't have sync'd to Windows as user was not connected to VPN
Resolution: Made Brayan login to Cisco VPN by clicking the icon from right bottom corner of the Windows login screen with the HelpDesk provided password. This forced the password reset through VPN (even though it would show authentication failed, password would be updated in AD). After couple of minutes when the password got syncd in all AD Domain controllers, Brayan was again made to login to Cisco VPN from Windows login page and once successfully connected to VPN, he could log into to Windows.
